Thank you for putting a wholesome smile on my face. Your laugh made my heart melt and I love how you communicate with your fans. In pretty difficult times, I have been looking at your live sessions and clips and immediately feel like a blessed individual. Thank you so much for being who you are, and I hope that we will see more great content from you! ❤️"

I never imagined you'd be my biggest reason to start picking up Japanese again, seeing your duolingo streams and realizing how hard it is for the Japanese such as you to learn English.\nThere'll be rainy days and bumpy roads for as long you delve in this journey, but I humbly ask that you remember that you have brought joy and happiness to hundreds of thousands of souls that are watching you. And for that, we will all be with you to go through the rough patches as your viewers, friends or mayhaps, family. Come back whenever you think you're ready! All of us are missing you dearly, Uto-chan!💙💙"
